<h2>Section 4: Practical Problem-Solving</h2><br />
<br />
<h3>Task: Create an Animated and Lazily Loaded Webpage</h3><br />
<br />
In this task, you'll be creating a simple webpage that showcases an animated element and implements lazy loading for images.<br />
<br />
<h3>Requirements:</h3><br />
<br />
1. <b>HTML Structure:</b> Start by creating the basic structure of the webpage using HTML. Include a header, a section for the animated element, and a gallery of images that need to be lazily loaded.<br />
<br />
2. <b>CSS Styling:</b> Apply basic CSS styling to make the webpage visually appealing. You can use your preferred styling techniques, but ensure the webpage is responsive.<br />
<br />
3. <b>Animation:</b> Create a CSS-animated element (such as a bouncing ball or a rotating icon) within the designated section. The animation should be smooth and engaging.<br />
<br />
4. <b>Lazy Loading:</b> Implement lazy loading for the gallery images using the Intersection Observer API. The images should only load when they come into the viewport.<br />
<br />
5. <b>User Experience:</b> When the images are loaded, apply a subtle fade-in animation to enhance the user experience.<br />
<br />
<h3>Step-by-Step Guide:</h3><br />
<br />
1. <b>HTML Setup:</b><br />
   - Create an HTML file and set up the basic structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.<br />
   - Inside the `<body>`, create a `<header>` element with a title.<br />
   - Create a `<section>` element with a unique identifier for the animated element.<br />
   - Within the section, add an `<img>` tag to represent the animated element.<br />
<br />
2. <b>CSS Styling:</b><br />
   - Link a CSS file to your HTML document.<br />
   - Apply CSS styles to achieve the desired layout and appearance for the header, section, and animated element.<br />
   - Implement CSS animations for the animated element using `@keyframes` and `animation` properties.<br />
<br />
3. <b>Animation:</b><br />
   - In your CSS file, define a new `@keyframes` animation that animates the animated element. For example, you can make it bounce or rotate.<br />
   - Apply this animation to the animated element using the `animation` property.<br />
<br />
4. <b>Lazy Loading:</b><br />
   - Create a JavaScript file and link it to your HTML document.<br />
   - In the JavaScript file, use the Intersection Observer API to observe the gallery images.<br />
   - When an image comes into the viewport, update its `src` attribute to trigger the lazy loading effect.<br />
<br />
5. <b>Fade-In Animation:</b><br />
   - Apply a CSS transition property to the images to create a smooth fade-in effect when they load.<br />
<br />
6. <b>Testing:</b><br />
   - Test your webpage in different browsers and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and proper functionality.<br />
<br />
<h3>Submission:</h3><br />
<br />
Please provide your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files along with any additional assets (such as images) in a compressed archive (e.g., ZIP format). Include clear comments in your code to explain your approach and any significant code sections.<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> You are not required to host the webpage online. Providing the source code is sufficient for assessment.<br />
<br />
<h3>Evaluation Criteria:</h3><br />
<br />
You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:<br />
- Correct implementation of HTML structure, CSS styling, and animations.<br />
- Proper implementation of the Intersection Observer API for lazy loading images.<br />
- Smooth and visually pleasing animations.<br />
- Code readability, organization, and comments.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the coding challenge! We look forward to reviewing your creative and technically sound solution.<br />
