                <h2 class="h2">Section 1: General Knowledge</h2>
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: Can you explain the key differences between native app development and cross-platform development using React Native or Vue Native?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> Native app development involves creating apps
                    specifically for a single platform, such as iOS or Android, using platform-specific languages and tools (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android). Cross-platform development with React Native or Vue Native allows developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms. These frameworks use JavaScript or TypeScript and provide a bridge to native components, offering a balance between code reusability and native performance.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>Q: How do you optimize the performance of a mobile app, and what tools or
                        techniques do you use for profiling and debugging?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> Performance optimization is crucial for a smooth user
                    experience. I use techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to reduce the app's
                    bundle size. For profiling and debugging, I rely on tools like React Native Debugger, Xcode
                    Instruments (for iOS), and Android Profiler (for Android). These tools help identify bottlenecks,
                    memory leaks, and UI rendering issues, allowing me to fine-tune the app's performance.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What is the significance of responsive design in mobile app development,
                        and how do you ensure your apps are responsive across different devices and screen
                        sizes?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> Responsive design ensures that an app looks and
                    functions well across various devices and screen sizes. To achieve this, I use layout techniques
                    like Flexbox and Grid to create flexible UIs. Media queries help adapt the layout and styles based
                    on screen dimensions. Additionally, I conduct thorough testing on multiple devices and emulators to
                    ensure responsiveness and address any layout or usability issues.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="h2">Section 2: Technical Knowledge</h2>
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: Could you describe the component lifecycle in React Native or Vue Native,
                        and how do you handle state management within your mobile apps?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> React Native and Vue Native have similar component
                    lifecycles. Components go through stages like "mounting," "updating," and "unmounting." State
                    management varies; for React Native, I often use Redux or the Context API for global state. For Vue
                    Native, Vuex is a great choice. These libraries help maintain centralized state and ensure data
                    consistency across components.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What are some best practices for implementing animations in mobile apps,
                        and can you provide an example of a complex animation you've created in the past?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> When implementing animations, it's important to use
                    hardware acceleration, which ensures smooth animations. I also leverage libraries like React
                    Native's Animated or Vue Native's Vue Transition for more complex animations. An example of a
                    complex animation I've worked on is a shopping cart animation in an e-commerce app, where items
                    smoothly slide into the cart with interactive feedback.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>Q: How do you handle data synchronization and real-time updates in
                        e-commerce mobile applications, especially when dealing with large datasets and multiple
                        users?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> Data synchronization and real-time updates are vital
                    for e-commerce apps. I utilize technologies like WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database to achieve
                    real-time updates. For handling large datasets efficiently, I implement pagination, lazy loading,
                    and server-side filtering. Caching frequently accessed data also reduces the need for constant
                    server requests, enhancing app performance.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="h2">Section 3: Project Experience</h2>
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: Please share details about a challenging project you've worked on in the
                        past. What obstacles did you face, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> One challenging project involved migrating a legacy
                    e-commerce app to a modern React Native codebase. The main obstacles were data migration,
                    maintaining feature parity, and ensuring a smooth transition for users. We tackled this by
                    meticulously planning the migration, conducting extensive testing, and gradually rolling out
                    updates. Effective communication within the team and with stakeholders was key to success.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>Q: Have you integrated third-party APIs or SDKs into your mobile apps? If
                        so, can you discuss a specific integration and the challenges you encountered?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> Yes, I've integrated various APIs and SDKs. For
                    instance, in an e-commerce app, we integrated a payment gateway. Challenges included handling
                    various payment methods, ensuring data security, and managing user authentication. We addressed
                    these challenges through careful API documentation review, error handling strategies, and robust
                    security measures.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>Q: Can you provide examples of your contributions to the development of
                        e-commerce mobile apps, including any innovative features or improvements you
                        introduced?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer"><span class="answer">A:</span> In a previous e-commerce project, I introduced a
                    product recommendation engine that utilized machine learning algorithms to personalize product
                    suggestions for users. This feature significantly improved user engagement and sales. Additionally,
                    I optimized the checkout process, reducing cart abandonment rates by streamlining the payment flow
                    and enhancing the user experience.</p>
