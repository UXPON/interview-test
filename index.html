<h2>Section 4: Practical Problem-Solving</h2>

<h3>Task: Create an Animated and Lazily Loaded Webpage</h3>

In this task, you'll be creating a simple webpage that showcases an animated element and implements lazy loading for images.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

1. <b>HTML Structure:</b> Start by creating the basic structure of the webpage using HTML. Include a header, a section for the animated element, and a gallery of images that need to be lazily loaded.

2. <b>CSS Styling:</b> Apply basic CSS styling to make the webpage visually appealing. You can use your preferred styling techniques, but ensure the webpage is responsive.

3. <b>Animation:</b> Create a CSS-animated element (such as a bouncing ball or a rotating icon) within the designated section. The animation should be smooth and engaging.

4. <b>Lazy Loading:</b> Implement lazy loading for the gallery images using the Intersection Observer API. The images should only load when they come into the viewport.

5. <b>User Experience:</b> When the images are loaded, apply a subtle fade-in animation to enhance the user experience.

<h3>Step-by-Step Guide:</h3>

1. <b>HTML Setup:</b>
   - Create an HTML file and set up the basic structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
   - Inside the `<body>`, create a `<header>` element with a title.
   - Create a `<section>` element with a unique identifier for the animated element.
   - Within the section, add an `<img>` tag to represent the animated element.

2. <b>CSS Styling:</b>
   - Link a CSS file to your HTML document.
   - Apply CSS styles to achieve the desired layout and appearance for the header, section, and animated element.
   - Implement CSS animations for the animated element using `@keyframes` and `animation` properties.

3. <b>Animation:</b>
   - In your CSS file, define a new `@keyframes` animation that animates the animated element. For example, you can make it bounce or rotate.
   - Apply this animation to the animated element using the `animation` property.

4. <b>Lazy Loading:</b>
   - Create a JavaScript file and link it to your HTML document.
   - In the JavaScript file, use the Intersection Observer API to observe the gallery images.
   - When an image comes into the viewport, update its `src` attribute to trigger the lazy loading effect.

5. <b>Fade-In Animation:</b>
   - Apply a CSS transition property to the images to create a smooth fade-in effect when they load.

6. <b>Testing:</b>
   - Test your webpage in different browsers and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and proper functionality.

<h3>Submission:</h3>

Please provide your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files along with any additional assets (such as images) in a compressed archive (e.g., ZIP format). Include clear comments in your code to explain your approach and any significant code sections.

<b>Note:</b> You are not required to host the webpage online. Providing the source code is sufficient for assessment.

<h3>Evaluation Criteria:</h3>

You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Correct implementation of HTML structure, CSS styling, and animations.
- Proper implementation of the Intersection Observer API for lazy loading images.
- Smooth and visually pleasing animations.
- Code readability, organization, and comments.

Good luck with the coding challenge! We look forward to reviewing your creative and technically sound solution.
